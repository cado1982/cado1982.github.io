Dot is an iOS app that will help keep track of your baby's activity.

Log feeds, sleeps, changes, and measurements on a day-to-day basis. See at a glance when your baby last woke up, last fed, and was last changed.

Look back over your historical data to spot trends and see how far your baby has come!
